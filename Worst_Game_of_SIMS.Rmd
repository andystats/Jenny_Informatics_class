## Coefficients
Coefficients of the logistic regression model used to impute PTSD outcomes in Kessler et al\footnote{Kessler RC, Duncan GJ, Gennetian LA, et al.: Associations of housing mobility interventions for children in high-poverty neighborhoods with subsequent mental disorders during adolescence. JAMA. 2014; 311(9):
937â€“948.}

## Estimate probability of PTSD

```{r}
bx<-x%*%beta
Z<-exp(bx)
p<-Z/(1+Z)
```

The probability of this SIM have PTSD is: `r p`
